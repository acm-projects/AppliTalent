<!--OVERVIEW-->
# Overview
   A simple web application that would allow college students/ internship applicants to organize and keep track of their applications and the corresponding details. Every student knows that the application process is long and tedious with multiple steps to each individual positionâ€™s application. It would be a unified place to store every aspect of one's application.

<!--ABOUT SECTION-->
# About The Project
**Main Features**
  - User Accounts: 
      - Login with a username and password to keep track of all of the applications that you applied at during the recruitment cycle.
  - Add Application Page:
      - Add an application that you may want to keep track of and fill in information that the card will ask such as company name, location, position, wage/salary, application number and much more. 
  - Statistics Page
      - A bar graph that shows the user how many applications are in each of the statuses accepted, rejected, pending, and negotiating.
  - Customize Your View
      - With the web app, you will be able to sort your applications alphabetically by company, most recent application date applied, and salary highest to lowest. 
      - You can also change the viewability of the cards such as looking at it in a list view or a grid view. 
      - Looking for a certain application that you stored in the system, you will also be able to search for it at any time you need it. 
 
**Tech Stack**
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - React was used to create all the UI components of the application. CSS provided the styling. React router was used to allow navigation to other pages.
  - [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - For the users, we used Firestore to help store the applications and make changes to applications as they were being added in. We also used Firebase User Authentication to create and authenticate users with the sign-up and log in forms. This also allows users to keep track of all their data and make it customizable to their preferences.
