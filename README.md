# AppliTalent
Manage and track your job or internship prospects with an intuitive web app.

A web application that would allow internship/full-time applicants to organize and keep track of their applications and the corresponding details. Every student knows that the application process is long and tedious with multiple steps to each individual position application. It would be a unified place to store every aspect of applications.

MVP:

- User accounts 
- Main page that would display all application cards that have been created in different stages like application submitted, contacted recruiter/company contact, technical assessment completed, interview 1,2,etc completed, rejected, offer made, offer accepted, offer declined, and any others.
- Creating an application card which would be where key information about the application is stored such as title, req number, description. 
    - Each card could have a checklist of the stages of the application process which would be checked off and allow for organization on the main page.
- Users can set reminders for when a schedule interview, technical assessment, or due date is.

Stretch Goals:

- Chat feature to communicate with other peopleâ€™s profile for advice
- A calendar tracker to display each due dates
- Displays stats on the application in the profile like the number of applications, number of interviews, etc.
